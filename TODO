TODO
====

-add Graph class and generic find (node.graph.find(value=13),
node.tree.find(value=13) ?)

-implement shortest path algo (Dijkstra) (shortest_path(node1, node2)) ? ->
this needs edge weights! -> add additional structure that allows to set them?
it would be possible to expect that each edge has weight of 1 by default
