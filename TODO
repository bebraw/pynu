-add generic find (node.find(value=13)) that finds from all!
-implement shortest path algo (Dijkstra) (short_path(node1, node2))
-make sure find does not fail on cyclic cases
-make sure it's not possible to append to a TreeNode in such a way that causes
a loop
-make code pep8 compatible
-add proper long_description to setup.py like at
http://github.com/cburroughs/pep8.py/blob/master/setup.py
