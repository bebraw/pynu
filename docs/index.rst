Overview of Pynu (Python Node Utilities)
========================================

The library offers two helper classes, DirectedGraphNode and TreeNode. TreeNode
can be considered to be a special case of a DirectedGraphNode. A TreeNode may
have only one parent at a time. In addition it provides functionality to find
the root of the tree (find_root) and to walk through each node of the tree
based on the node used as a pivot.
